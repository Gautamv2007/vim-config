This is a very basic init.lua config. This is the people who don't want very complicated configuration and at the same time don't want to lose any basic config. 

The transparent feature may not work on the latest gnome terminal. It is impossible to config it anymore. I wasted a lot of time doing it. 
I would recommend using Alacritty or any other terminal of your choice which support transparent configuration.

Anyway enjoy Neovim!!

For adding this file in ubuntu follow the below steps:
1. cd ~/.config
2. mkdir nvim
3. nvim init.lua
4. Inside the file copy paste this code(If you know how to do it.)
5. Save the file and type the command :source
6. Finally you can make any changes you want.
